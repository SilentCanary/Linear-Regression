# Song-Popularity-Prediction
A C++ linear regression model built from scratch, predicting song popularity based on the Spotify Trackset dataset. Implements gradient descent, hypothesis function, and feature normalization without using any external libraries. It evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (still working on reducing error in model performance).
